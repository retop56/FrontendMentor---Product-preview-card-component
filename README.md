## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to use media queries to change design elements in CSS based on the width of the device viewport.

- How to debug the page using Chrome Developer Tools

- How to position a background image in CSS

- How to use CSS custom variables

- How to not lose it when I'm stuck on a certain part (take a break!!!)

### Continued development

Need to get more comfortable with Flexbox. I don't have a firm enough grasph on it yet, but I know with more effort I'll get there.
